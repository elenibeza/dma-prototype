The American Forces Public Information Management System (AFPIMS) is a combination of hardware and software used to manage public-facing Department of Defense websites. The software component of AFPIMS is called the content management system (CMS).  AFPIMS runs on a core operating system called DotNetNuke (DNN) with enhancements added to the codebase to provide greater flexibility, ease of use, and security.  The premise of AFPIMS is users can apply the CMS's functionality to create and manage pages on their websites.
